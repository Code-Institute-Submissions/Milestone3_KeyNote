Aside from politics, he has had a highly successful and varied career as a businessman, actor, professional body builder, model, producer, director, investor, philanthropist and writer. One of the major accomplishments Schwarzenegger achieved as Governor was the establishment of the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 - a bipartisan agreement to combat global warming by reducing California's greenhouse gas emissions. His Strategic Growth Plan aimed to reduce congestion and clean the air; the Hydrogen Highway by Executive Order supported the transition to a clean hydrogen transportation economy; the Million Solar Roofs Initiative had the goal of bringing 3,000 megawatts of clean energy online by 2017; and the Safe, Clean and Reliable Drinking Water Supply Act was passed in 2010. Other successes include leading the reform to make California competitive for up to $700 million in federal Race to the Top funds, which ensures that all California's students have access to the world-class education they need to thrive. He signed legislation making the state's school nutrition standards the most progressive in the nation and also, his support for the After-School Education & Safety Act in 2002, has made California the first state to significantly invest in a comprehensive after-school program. In 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger was appointed Chair of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. He also served as Chair of the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. He received the Simon Wiesenthal Center's 'National Leadership Award' for his support of the organisation's Holocaust studies. In 2002, Schwarzenegger was awarded the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Award. For his films, Arnold Schwarzenegger received a Golden Globe Award for Best Newcomer for his performance in Stay Hungry (1976). He has had a leading role in many popular action films, including Conan the Barbarian (1982), The Terminator (1984) and its two sequels, True Lies (1994) and Batman & Robin (1997). He played comedy roles in films Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990), and Junior (1994). As a businessman, his first investment was in a brick laying business. He followed this with a mail-order bodybuilding equipment company and invested in real estate, becoming a millionaire before he started his acting career. He was a founding investor in the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain.")

Leading four departments over nine years and rising to the second most powerful job in government, he is one of only three people to serve continuously in the UK cabinet from 2010 to 2019, serving under Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May. Taking on the role of Chancellor of the Exchequer shortly after the 2016 Brexit Referendum, Hammond took charge of the British economy at a time of unprecedented uncertainty. Philip Hammond has always strongly held the view that nobody voted for Brexit with a view to becoming poorer or less secure, and thus believes the best way of delivering the result of the referendum is to negotiate a deal with the European Union that keeps the UK and EU close economically, even after the UK leaves the EU. He fought strongly for this approach within the cabinet and has continued to do so since leaving government. He also focused on the needs of businesses and particularly the need to protect London’s global financial markets. Philip Hammond has focused on the challenges faced by developed economies, specifically: the technological revolution and how it is already transforming the way we work and live our lives; climate change and how to harness the market economy to deliver decarbonisation; demographic shifts and the challenges of an ageing population, and particularly in the UK, the challenge of raising productivity. Through his roles as Chancellor and as Foreign Secretary, Hammond has considerable experience of working with China, and clear views about how to manage the integration of China as a major economic and strategic power into the global system. He also has strong connections in the Gulf region. He was part of the “E3+3” team that negotiated the JCPOA nuclear arms control deal with Iran in 2015. During his tenure as Defence and then Foreign Secretary, Hammond built strong links with the US and other allied counterparts, both civilian and military, and was a frequent visitor to Afghanistan during the campaign. Philip Hammond retains a close interest in the strategic challenges facing the Western Alliance and then interrelationship between economic and strategic influences.   Hammond grew up in Essex, England, and studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at University College Oxford. Before entering Parliament in 1997, he ran a number of successful businesses. He remains the Member of Parliament for the Surrey constituency of Runnymede and Weybridge.")
